				<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;margin-bottom: 5px">About The Department</h3>
				<p><strong>The Department is Headed by Dr. Santosh B S. B.E, M.Tech, Ph.D</strong></p>
				<p>The Department of Civil Engineering has been established in the year 2009 and it is one of the young and upcoming departments with high quality of teaching and learning aspects. The department has well qualified, dedicated and experienced staff members. Department is well equipped with excellent laboratory facilities and established good industry and institution relationship in the form of organizational membership with ACCE(I), Bangalore and ICI-KB centre. The faculty of Civil Engg actively participates in research, consultancy and testing of building materials to cater the requirement of construction industry and presently the good numbers of faculty members are carrying out doctoral research (Ph.D) in the different areas. The department is recognized as VTU-research centre in the year 2014. Department also organizes Value Added Programs like BIM (Building Information Module) to the students to bridge the gap of theory and field practice of civil engineering through Civil Engineering Association (CEA).<br><br>
                Civil Engineering is considered as the first discipline of the various branches of Engineering after Military Engineering, and includes the Designing, Planning, Construction, and maintenance of the infrastructure. Department of Civil Engineering started in the year 2009 is now in an infant stage. A strong foundation is laid with well qualified faculty and latest equipment to facilitate the gradual development of the department. All faculty members are presently pursuing Ph.D.</p>

                <h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;margin-bottom: 5px">From the Desk of HOD</h3>
                <p style="margin-top: 4px ">There is a wide gap between the requirement and the availability of Civil Engineers in all sectors. The investment in road sector alone is estimated as Rs.2.79 lakh crores in the eleventh five year plan. The opportunities open to forthcoming Civil Engineers are enormous. The challenge is to prepare the students graduating from the department to achieve the required skills and knowledge.</p>
